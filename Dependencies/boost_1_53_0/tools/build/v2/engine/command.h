/*
 * command.h - the CMD structure and routines to manipulate them
 *
 * Both ACTION and CMD contain a rule, targets, and sources.  An
 * ACTION describes a rule to be applied to the given targets and
 * sources; a CMD is what actually gets executed by the shell.  The
 * differences are due to:
 *
 *  ACTIONS must be combined if 'actions together' is given.
 *  ACTIONS must be split if 'actions piecemeal' is given.
 *  ACTIONS must have current sources omitted for 'actions updated'.
 *
 * The CMD datatype holds a single command that is to be executed
 * against a target, and they can chain together to represent the
 * full collection of commands used to update a target.
 *
 * Structures:
 *
 *  CMD - an action, ready to be formatted into a buffer and executed.
 *
 * External routines:
 *
 *  cmd_new() - return a new CMD or 0 if too many args.
 *  cmd_free() - delete CMD and its parts.
 *  cmd_next() - walk the CMD chain.
