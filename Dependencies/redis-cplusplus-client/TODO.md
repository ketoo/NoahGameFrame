command handlers:
- find a useable concept for MULTI/EXEC transactions (and implement it)
- support SUBSCRIBE/PUBLISH commands
- provide template methods (iterator based) for all container based calls
- deliver the error messages from redis-server in thrown exceptions
- configureable behavour in sharded mode, if keys are not on the same server
- use slave servers 

unit tests:
- sort with limit
- sort lexicographically
- sort with pattern and weights
- check test couverage with a tool like gcov

extras:
- streaming versions for multi-bulk commands (and maybe also for GET and SET for better support of very large values)
- more complete benchmarking
- switch networking code to boost::asio with non parallel access of different cluster nodes
- support non POSIX systems
- support compilers other than g++
- merge duplicate code

maybe/someday:
- make all string literals constants so they can be easily changed
