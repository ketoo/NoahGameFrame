The purpose of eglib is to be an X11-licensed subset of glib that can
be used with Mono when the Mono runtime is explicitly relicensed under
a different license by Novell.

The implementation is done from the public documentation available here:

    http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/2.0/glib/

Currently this is only being built standalone, use:

	  ./autogen.sh --prefix=/tmp/test

Currently all the definitions go into a single file: glib.h, there are 
no separate files, please try to follow the convetions in the source code

* Tests
	
	Please read the README in tests/

* Features

	The source code is designed to allow for different operating
	system builds of the eglib code.

	Files in src that:

	  * Have a plain name: are cross platform, and should work on
	    every operating system.

	  * That end in -unix.c: These files contain Unix specific code.

	  * That end in -win32.c: These files contain Win32 specific code.

	  * That end in -posix.c: Will work on both Windows and Unix,
            but should not be included for other operating systems. 

* Plans: short and long term.

	The short term plans for eglib is to allow Mono to optionally
	build with it instead of using glib, gmodule and gthread, but
	the default build will continue to be done against glib 2.0.

	In the long-term we are considering dropping glib as a
	dependency, considering that Mono requires a modern Unix
	system to run anyways (for its thread support) it would allow
	us to fix some of the glib API limitations we have to live
	with (explicit thread support for example), rework the API to
	use types from stdint.h and we would be able to drop three
	external shared libraries.

	This would reduce memory usage for the handful of routines
	that we use from glib, dynamic linker overhead for those and
	would allow us to tune the implementation to Mono's needs.
