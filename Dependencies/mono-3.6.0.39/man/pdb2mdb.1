.SH NAME 
pdb2mdb \- Program Database to Mono Debugging Symbol converter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdb2mdb
pdb_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
This tool is used to convert debugging symbols generated by
Microsoft's compilers into debugging symbols that can be consumed by
Mono's runtime.
.PP
Program Database files are files that end with the extension .pdb and
are associated with a library or executable (a .dll or .exe file).
This format was until recently not documented so Mono used its own
file format for storing debugging information, the Mono debugging
format.  
.PP
Just like PDB files Mono Debugging information is stored in files that
reside side-by-side with a program executable or a library. 
.PP
You can use the pdb2mdb tool to transform these PDB files into MDB
files that Mono can then consume to debug programs or provide
line-number information for stack traces or exceptions.
