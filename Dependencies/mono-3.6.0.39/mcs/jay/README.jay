    This version of Berkeley Yacc was taken from the BSD-Lite CD and targeted
to Java by

			axel.schreiner@informatik.uni-osnabrueck.de

Makefile -> makefile	removed Berkeleyisms, call it jay
defs.h			eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file, #ident
			eliminate sekeleton.c references
error.c			eliminate %union
main.c			eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file
output.c		eliminate -dlpr options, %union, output_file
			fix #define, short, -t/yyDebug
			respell YYERRCODE, YYTABLESIZE, YYFINAL, YYMAXTOKEN
			output trailer last
			switch to filter behaviour
reader.c		eliminate output_file, #ident
			#line -> // line, pass //
			yyvsp[] -> yyVals[yyTop], yyval -> yyVal
skeleton.c -> skeleton	Java skeleton
test			removed
yacc.1 -> jay.1		adapted
yyfix.*			removed

Types: there is a significant difference. yacc uses %union to cast the value
stack and <tag> to select alternatives. This works for l- and r-values alike.
jay uses Object as the value stack and <tag> to set a class. l-values must not
be cast. $n should not be assigned to, but $$ usually is. $n is referenced,
but $$ usually is not. Consequently jay casts $n and $<tag>$ but not $<>n
and $$. This makes assignment to $n references to $$ kludgily possible.
As another kludge, to prevent 'untyped' messages and to avoid unnecessary
casts, casts to "Object" are not emitted.
