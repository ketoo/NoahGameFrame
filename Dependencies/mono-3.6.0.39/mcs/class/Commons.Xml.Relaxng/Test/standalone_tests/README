
* Standalone test collection for Commons.Xml.Relaxng.dll

** standalone RELAX NG test program for the Test Suite

  It is a test runner for James Clark's test collection.

  prep.xsl is originally included in Jing (a Java implementation of RELAX NG
  validator). copying.html is license information for prep.xsl and relaxng.rng.


** standalone RELAX NG Compact Syntax test program for the "anglia" test suite

  It is a test runner for Jeff Rafter's "anglia" RNC test collection.


** How to build

  NOTE: To set up test runner, you need xsltproc, which is included in libxslt.
  (Since the stylesheet uses extensions, we cannot use our xslt engine.)

  "make" will do the same as "make relaxngtest.exe" and 
  "make anglia-test-runner.exe".

  "make relaxngtest.exe" will download the test collection from 
  http://www.thaiopensource.com/relaxng/testSuite.zip and then run
  xsltproc to split tests and create test directories and files, and finally
  will compile relaxngtest.cs.

  "make anglia-test-runner.exe" will download the test collection from
  http://www.jeffrafter.com/anglia/anglia-test-suite.zip , and then will expand
  that archive, and finally will compile anglia-test-runner.cs.


*** How to run

  "make test" will run relaxngtest.exe and will output the error cases.

  "make anglia-test" will run anglia-test-runner.exe and will output the
  error cases.
