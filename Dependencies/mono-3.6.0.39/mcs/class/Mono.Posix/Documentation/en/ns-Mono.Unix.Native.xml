    <summary>Low-level Unix wrapper types.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The Mono.Unix.Native namespace contains 
        low-level wrapper classes, structures, and enumerations
        which are accessible from the <see cref="T:Mono.Unix.Native.Syscall"/> 
        and <see cref="T:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib"/> classes, which are
        a low-level wrappers over ANSI C, POSIX and Unix system calls and library
        functions.</para>
      <block subset="none" type="note">
        <para>Thread-safety wasn't handled in the original Unix API.  While
        some degree of thread-safety is provided from managed code, it is
        impossible to provide full thread-safety for interactions between
        managed and unmanaged code.  For example, if you DllImport into a C
        library which uses non-thread-safe Unix functions which are also
        exposed in Mono.Unix.Native, you may have threading issues including, but not
        limited to, memory corruption.</para>
        <para>An effort is made to provide thread-safety from managed code,
        but it is impossible to know all dependencies for all potential
        Unix-like platforms.  For example, is <see
        cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.fopen"/> thread-safe?  It appears to be under
        glibc, but isn't necessarily under all Unix platforms.  
        <c>Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib</c> assumes that it is.  Only <i>obviously</i> 
        unsafe exports are actually synchronized from managed code, such as 
        <see cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.tmpnam"/> and 
        <see cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.strerror"/>.</para>
