    <summary>High-level Unix wrapper types.</summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>The Mono.Unix namespace contains 
        high-level wrapper classes, which provide .NET naming and
        usage conventions over the low-level 
        <see cref="T:Mono.Unix.Native.Syscall" /> and 
        <see cref="T:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib" /> functionality.

				If an exception is generated due to an operating system-level error
				(as opposed to invalid arguments or some fully managed reason), the
				exception thrown will either inherit from 
				<see cref="T:Mono.Unix.UnixIOException"/>, or the
				<see cref="P:System.Exception.InnerException"/> property will be a
				type inheriting from <c>UnixIOException</c>.  In either case, the
				<see cref="P:Mono.Unix.UnixIOException.ErrorCode"/> property will
				contain the underlying error number that generated the exception.
				This error number can be used to look up additional information if
				necessary.

        <para>Thread-safety wasn't considered in the original Unix API.  While
        some degree of thread-safety is provided from managed code, it is
        impossible to provide full thread-safety for interactions between
        managed and unmanaged code.  For example, if you DllImport into a C
        library which uses non-thread-safe Unix functions which are also
        exposed in Mono.Unix, you may have threading issues including, but not
        limited to, memory corruption.</para>
        <para>An effort is made to provide thread-safety from managed code,
        but it is impossible to know all dependencies for all potential
        Unix-like platforms.  For example, is <see
        cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.fopen"/> thread-safe?  It appears to be under
        glibc, but isn't necessarily under all Unix platforms.  
        <c>Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib</c> assumes that it is.  Only <i>obviously</i> 
        unsafe exports are actually synchronized from managed code, such as 
        <see cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.tmpnam"/> and 
        <see cref="M:Mono.Unix.Native.Stdlib.strerror"/>.</para>
