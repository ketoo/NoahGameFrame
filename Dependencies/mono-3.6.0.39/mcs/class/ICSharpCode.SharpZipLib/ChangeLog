	* Import 0.84 version of SharpZipLib and merge local changes. This is
	needed by newer versions of IKVM.
	
	* ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib: Remove 0.6 version.

	* Makefile (LIBRARY_SNK): Sign with SharpZipLib.key.  The library
	is delay-signed according to ICSharpCode.SharpZipLib/AssemblyInfo.cs.

	* Makefile: Don't sign this assembly as it is fully signed during
	compilation (we have the original private key). Thanks to Jackson.

	* SharpZipLib.pub: Added public key.
