* System.Xml.Schema standalone test collections


** Small XML Schema validation test system::

	This is a small standalone test system using W3C XML Schema 
	test collection.
	http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xmlschema-test-collection.html

	"make" will prepare whatever you need to run test (downloading test
	archive from W3C, expanding, compiling test runner).

	"make run-test" will run the tests and reports as TestResult.xml.


** Post Schema Compilation Information comparison test::

	This is a test for Post Schema Compilation Information properties.

	xs-pcsi-compare.exe emits properties of schema object model.
	pcsi-ms-all.zip contains msxsdtest result I got from MS.NET 1.1.

	(Currently no other way to compare the results by hands.)

As for the result differences, some notes would be required:

	- MS.NET holds incorrect base schema type for simple list and union
	  types. Their base type is simple ur-type (3.14.7) but MS.NET holds
	  item type(s) there.

	- For unspecified types for element and attribute, they incorrectly
	  specifies xs:string type. However in those cases, attribute types
	  should be mapped to simple ur-type and element types should be
	  (complex) ur-type (3.4.7)

This will be added in the future (currently Mono has the same problem).

	- MS.NET does not remove "pointless" choice particle (see 3.9.6).
	  However it results in incorrect validation.
	  (e.g. msxsdtest/Particles/particlesHb010.xsd)
