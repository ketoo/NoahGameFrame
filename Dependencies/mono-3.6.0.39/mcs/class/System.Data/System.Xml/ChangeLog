	* XmlDataDocument.cs (StringToObject): Modify
	XmlConvert.ToDateTime to use XmlDateTimeSerializationMode, as the
	default ToDataTime method id obsolete.

2006-04-19  Senganal T <tsenganal@novell.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs : 
		- Use encoded names for DataSet schema.
		- StringToElement : Return 'null' if the value is empty string
		or null.
		- OnDataTableRowAdded : Add the row elements to the tablenode if
		they are not already added.

	* XmlDataDocument.cs :
	  - It was not handling SimpleContent. This fixes bug #56951.
	  - It was not converting values into DataType of the DataColumn.

2004-05-17  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs :
	  Removed MonoTODO from implemented members and private members.
	  Updated OnNodeRemoved(), OnDataRowDeleted() and OnDataTableRollback()
	  to match with current implementation.

2004-05-13  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs : Removed row-element mapping. Just use new
	  DataRow.DataElement property. Added/removed some comments.

2004-05-12  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs : Radical design change.
	  - GetElementFromRow() must return "detached" element, even if it is
	    not added to table's Rows.
	  - Introduced XmlDataElement class to map element (this class itself)
	    and DataRow _always_ . It is impossible to map *all* DataRows 
	    to/from elements only in XmlDataDocument API, since DataRow can 
	    be created separate from it (i.e. by table.NewRow()).
	  - Removed unreliable GetElementsByTagName() dependency from most
	    of the code, since users might create elements that has the same
	    name of any tables (that is possible especially unmapped elements).
	  - Adding/Removing delegates on every event action is unnecessary.
	    Use just flags.
	  - For Load(), just using base.Load() will do most of the job.
	  - Attributes and SimpleContents are not handled properly.

	  "Removed" and "Rollback" events are still TODO.

2004-04-13  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs:
	  Load() should not read xml multiple time nor expect BaseURI (and it
	  indicates the resource location is readable).
	  Simplified event handling logic, and fixed missing event removal.
	  Quick hack to avoid new XmlDataDocument(DataSet ds).Load ().
	  Enabled CreateNavigator() that was commented out.

2004-03-18  Atsushi Enomoto <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs : Fixed incorrect cast in OnDataTableRowAdded().
	  This fixes bug #54505.

2003-07-31  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs (BaseURI):
	(InnerXml):
	(IsReadOnly):
	(this):
	(LocalName):
	(Name):
	(OwnerDocument):
	(WriteContentTo):
	(WriteTo): Removed, these do not need to be redefined, as
	they are inherited from XmlDocument already.

	(CreateElement): simplifed the
	implementation. XmlDocument.CreateElement can handle String.Empty
	and null just fine.

2003-03-12  Alan Tam <Tam@SiuLung.com>

	* XmlDataDocument.cs: Still need to print tag for the DataSet if there
	is no data at all.

	* XmlDataDocument.cs: Some little fixes.
