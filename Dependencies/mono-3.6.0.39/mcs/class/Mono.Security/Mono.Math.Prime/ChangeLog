	* PrimalityTests.cs: Last attempt half-failed. For the time being we
	need the initial workaround :(

2007-07-05  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com> 

	* PrimalityTests.cs: Added Test method that select which algorithm, 
	SPP or RabinMillerTest, to use based on the prime-candidate size. 
	Removed previous workaround (as this is both a workaround and a good
	fix ;-).

	* PrimalityTests.cs: Rewritten RabinMillerTest to be closer to the 
	original algorithm (easier to understand/debug). Added a workaround
	for #81857 when the prime is small (less than 100 bits) so we can keep
	the a (base) == 2 optimization for larger primes.

	* PrimalityTests.cs: Applying optimization from HAC section 4.50 
	(base == 2) for a 30% gain in primality testing (medium confidence).

	* PrimalityTests.cs: FxCop-ized. CLS compliance. Removed local RNG.

	* ConfidenceFactor.cs: New. Copied from corlib. Required for PKCS1 and
	RSAManaged (which are required for TLS).
