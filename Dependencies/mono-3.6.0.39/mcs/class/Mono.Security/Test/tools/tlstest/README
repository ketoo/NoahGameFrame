The tlstest directory contains several test tools. They were made to test
the SSL/TLS implementation but most of them are also good test for regular
HTTP (when used with HttpWebRequest).


tlstest
	* works with HttpWebRequest (--web) or SslClientStream (--ssl | --tls)
	* work synchronously;

tlsmulti
	* only works with HttpWebRequest (http or https)
	* work asynchronously with Begin|EndGetResponse;
	* can download up to 64 URLs simulteanously;

tlsasync
	* only works with HttpWebRequest (http or https)
	* work asynchronously with Begin|EndGetResponse and [Begin|End]
	GetResponseStream;
	* can download up to 64 URLs simulteanously;

tlssave
	* only works with HttpWebRequest (http or https)
	* work asynchronously with Begin|EndGetResponse and [Begin|End]
	GetResponseStream;
	* saves every downloaded URL into a file (1, 2, ...);
	* used to download and compare (md5sum) very large files;


Note: With Mono the HttpWebRequest will call the SslClientStream for HTTPS.
However under the MS runtime SslClientStream won't be called.
