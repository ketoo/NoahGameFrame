Here are some test tools for Mono.Security assembly.

- tlstest
	SSL3/TLS1 tool to securely download web pages. The tool will show
	details if the certificate isn't trusted (or any other certificate
	realted error).

- cutcli
	SSL3/TLS1 tool that can cut the transmission (read or write) after
	"n" bytes are sent/received. This can simulate a server that hangs
	in the middle of a record. It can also be used to simulate DoS as
	the connection isn't closed.

- postecho
	SSL3/TLS1 tool to post a buffer to a web server and check that it
	was echoed back correctly. Requires a script on the server side.

- npdbtest
	Npgsql-based tool to test the SSL implementation. Requires PostgreSQL
	installed.
