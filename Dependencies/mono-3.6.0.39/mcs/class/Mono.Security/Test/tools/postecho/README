POSTECHO

To run the postecho tool your web server must have a script present to return
the TEST variable value to the tool.

The tool can use the HttpWebRequest|Response or the SslClientStream directly.
This is almost identical when executed on Mono but very different (execution
wise not result wise) if you test with the MS runtime.


POSTMULTI

To run the postmulti tool your web server(s) must have a script present to 
return the TEST variable value to the tool.

The tool use async HttpWebRequest|Response to send and receive a fixed (in
source code, default is 1 megabytes) length buffer from all URLs specified 
on the command line. 

The WaitHandle class has a limit of 64 handles. Supplying more than 64 URLs
on the command-line will result in a NotSupportedException exception.


NOTES

Available server-side scripts

1.	sendback.asp

	ASP script to return back the TEST value.

2.	sendback.aspx

	ASP.NET script to return back the TEST value.
