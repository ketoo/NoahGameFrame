mutual.exe is a test tool for mutual authentication. The tool works for both
SSL3 and TLS1 protocols. A script is provided to use OpenSSL as a server.

1. Testing TLS1 mutual authentication

% mono mutual.exe localhost TLS client.p12 demo


2. Testing SSL3 mutual authentication

% mono mutual.exe localhost SSL client.p12 demo


3. Testing TLS1 without mutual authentication [*]

% mono mutual.exe localhost TLS


4. Testing SSL3 without mutual authentication [*]

% mono mutual.exe localhost SSL


5. Testing TLS1 _optional_ mutual authentication [**]

% mono mutual.exe localhost TLS


6. Testing SSL3 _optional_ mutual authentication [**]

% mono mutual.exe localhost SSL



[*] OpenSSL (if used) requires a mutual authentication. So test #3 and #4 are
expected to fail.

[**] Test 5 and 6 must be executed with the serveropt.sh script running. Both
tests ARE NOT expected to fail.
