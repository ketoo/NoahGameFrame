	// Apparently this attribute is used in place of our BINDING_CONTAINER control mask bit,
	// which makes sense as in certain scenarios (e.g. TemplateControlAttribute naming a
	// container type which cannot be used for two-way binding) the check must be made on type,
	// not on object.
	//
	// This interface is briefly mentioned in:
	//  http://www.developmentnow.com/g/10_2006_6_0_0_776419/DataBinding-to-SubProperties.htm
	//
	// For a sample of why this is needed, see:
	//
	//  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.webcontrols.templatepagerfield.pagertemplate.aspx
	//  The C# code on the above page won't work without this interface being implemented and
	//  used in ControlBuilder.BindingContainerType. The reason why the sample wouldn't work is
	//  that the TemplatePagerField.PagerTemplate property carries a custom TemplateContainer
	//  (typeof (DataPagerFieldItem)) attribute and, without INonBindingContainer interface
	//  attached to DataPagerFieldItem, mono would generate code with the Container and
	//  BindingContainer referring to DataPagerFieldItem. In such case, attempting to access
	//  DataPager properties would obviously fail. Looking at the MS.NET generated code,
	//  Container and BindingContainer are of the DataPager type in this instance.
