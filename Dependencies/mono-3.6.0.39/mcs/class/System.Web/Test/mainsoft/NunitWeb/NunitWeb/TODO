CODE
* add PostableRequest for Cross Paging functionality. Important test case 
  and difficult work flow.

* add functionality for Mapping URL

* get rid of PageDelegates, unite it with PageInvoker, or give only a single
	delegate.
	
* replace PageHandlerFactory with custom handler in web.config, to get rid
	of WebTest.CurrentTest.DoInvoke (this) call from every page
	constructor.	

* get rid of CopyResource, find resources dynamically or copy all necessary
	resources on startup.

* make abstract interface unifying MyHost and WebTestHost

DOCUMENTATION

* add the documentation about instrumenting pages to add the test hooks
	("MonoTests.SystemWeb.Framework.WebTest.CurrentTest.Invoke(this);") and
	alternative ways of doing it.

* add the tutorial kind of documentation at the namespace and class levels

* bug with page event handlers set by += operator: exceptions are not processed
	correctly.
