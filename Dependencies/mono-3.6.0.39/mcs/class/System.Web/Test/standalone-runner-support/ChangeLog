	* TestRunner.cs, TestWorkerRequest.cs: added support for POST
	requests.

	* StandaloneTest.cs: added support for POST requests. Run items
	are executed in sequence and their results are preserved for the
	next run. If the next run is a POST one, form data is extracted
	from the previous response and used to generate POST data for the
	current one.
	Added a new property, FailedUrlCallbackName, which contains the
	fully qualified method name of the test callback which failed.
	Callback is no longer required to be present.

	* TestWorkerRequest.cs: added overloads of GetRawUrl and
	GetUriPath which make sure that the returned paths do not contain
	more than one leading / character.

	* TestRunItem.cs: added new TestRunData property - to contain
	per-appdomain test run data.

	* TestCallback.cs: added a TestRunItem parameter.

	* StandaloneTest.cs: runner object is created for each test item
	now.
	Added test progress feedback.

	* ITestRunner.cs: added two properties, TestRunData - to return
	collected test result data, if any, and Domain which returns the
	current AppDomain.

	* TestRunner.cs: Run makes sure Uri parser is passed a full url,
	or otherwise it won't be parsed correctly (will not parse the
	query part if an URL similar to '/file.html?query=value' is
	passed)

	* Helpers.cs: added a simple and naive method to extract query
	from WebResource.axd URLs. This is necessary because the query
	will be different each time the test is ran.
