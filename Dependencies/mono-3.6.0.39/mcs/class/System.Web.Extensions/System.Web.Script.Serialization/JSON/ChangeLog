	* JsonSerializer.cs: each value stored in an enumerable is treated
	as a top-level object.

	* JsonSerializer.cs: do not perform deep object serialization - it
	results in all kinds of problems (including too big size of the
	resulting string, recursion errors when two or more objects in the
	hierarchy hold a reference to some object) and is not what .NET
	code does. 
	Property name is written only after it is determined if we're
	serializing the property or not.
	Entire object is serialized only if it's the object requested for
	serialization by calling code.

	* JsonSerializer.cs: implemented a work-around for a bug in the
	SerializedLazyDictionary which would fail to serialize a type if
	any of its properties would throw an exception.
