	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: partial revert of r146546. The 'd' wrapper
	(and thus the JsonResult class) is needed after all. Fixes bug
	#571365

2009-11-19  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: removed the JsonResult class - it has no use
	and it can break applications (e.g. Umbraco)

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs, RestHandler.cs : add support for WCF proxy
	  generator. Make LogicalTypeInfo and LogicalMethodInfo abstract
	  and create sets of derivation for asmx and WCF. Large part of the
	  code still lives in abstract class, being reduced dependency on
	  ScriptServiceAttribute.

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: make sure JavaScriptSerializer instance used
	here reads custom converters from web.config. Fixes bug #525589

	* ScriptHandlerFactory.cs: handle precompiled web services.

2009-04-07 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@novell.com>

	* ClientProxyHandler.cs: set cacheability to public.

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: don't throw NREX when the passed type
	doesn't have a parameterless constructor in
	ShouldGenerateScript. Fixes bug #485435

2009-01-26  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* ClientProxyHandler.cs: before generating the proxy check if the
	service type is decorated with the [ScriptService] custom
	attribute. Only such service types can be called from client
	JavaScript.

2008-09-23  Marek Habersack  <mhabersack@novell.com>

	* LogicalTypeInfo.cs: do not use
	LazyDictionary as enum serializer anymore.

	* ProfileService.cs: do not use
	LazyDictionary as ProfileService serializer anymore.

	* RestHandler.cs: do not use
	LazyDictionary as the Exception or NameValueCollection serializer
	anymore.
