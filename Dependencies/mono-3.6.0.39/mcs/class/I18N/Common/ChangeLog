	* ByteEncoding.cs : Implemented IsAlwaysNormalized().
	  (only SingleByte and FormC may return true for IsAlwaysNormalized
	  on .NET.)
	  Ask String.Normalize() for every possible single byte character
	  which is valid for the encoding and see if it has changed the
	  string (i.e. it returns the value based on the actual
	  normalization.)

	* ByteEncoding.cs: Use unsafe code in GetString() that results in
	  significant performance improvement.

	* MonoEncoding.cs :
	  Added another overload that takes windows code page.

2006-01-23  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* MonoEncoding.cs :
	  Added abstract GetByteCountImpl() in MonoEncoding and MonoEncoder.
	  GetByteCount() is now based on the method above.
	* ByteEncoding.cs : so GetByteCount() became GetByteCountImpl() and
	  is based on char*.

	* MonoEncoding.cs, ByteEncoding.cs :
	  Marked as [Serializable].

2005-12-01  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* MonoEncoding.cs : new file, which is going to be used as the
	  abstract class for all Encoding classes in I18N.*.dll. Only
	  GetBytesImpl() is required in derived classes.
	* I18N.dll.sources : added above.
	* ByteEncoding : HandleFallback() is moved to MonoEncoding.
	  Now that only ToBytes() with pointers is required, commented out
	  other ToBytes() overloads.
	  GetBytesImpl() is implemented to call ToBytes() and thus all of
	  the derived classes work as they used to be.

	* Makefile : now it uses unsafe pointers.
	* ByteEncoding.cs : Now there is three versions of ToBytes(): the only
	  one with pointers will be in use in the future. ToBytes(string) and
	  ToBytes() with arrays will be implemented to dispatch pointer-based
	  one and will be only one conversion implementation while they keep
	  avoiding extra array creation.

2005-11-28  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* ByteEncoding.cs : added IsSingleByte.

2005-11-01  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Handler.cs : added 51949 (true euc-kr).

2005-09-25  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Handler.cs : added 50220 and 50222.

2005-09-18  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* Handler.cs : Required changes wrt some class renames.

2005-08-19  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	why didn't we have it? ;-)

	* Handlers.cs : added GB18030 support.
