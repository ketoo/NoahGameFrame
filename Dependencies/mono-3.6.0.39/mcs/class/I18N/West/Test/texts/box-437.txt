Box drawing characters
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

Box drawing characters are widely used in text user interfaces to draw various frames and boxes. In graphical user interfaces these characters are useless, because it is much simpler to draw lines and rectangles directly with graphical APIs; besides, box drawing characters work only with fixed-width fonts.

(NOTE: removed for testing Mono)

In all MS-DOS codepages box drawing characters are present, but their number is limited to 40:

³´µ¶·¸¹º»¼½¾¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÆÇÈÉÊËÌÍÎÏĞÑÒÓÔÕÖ×ØÙÚ

or even to 22:

³´¹º»¼¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÈÉÊËÌÍÎÙÚ

And for Unix programs, usually only 11 basic characters are available:

³´¿ÀÁÂÃÄÅÙÚ

or, on some terminals, they are not available at all, so they are replaced with such ASCII characters as '-', '|' and '+'.
