	* IpcChannelHelper.cs (copy): Take into account that the remoting
	stack is internally using MemoryStreams all over the place.
	Fixes bug #609381 as a side effect.

	* IpcChannel.cs (.ctor): Create an IpcClientChannel as well.

	* IpcClientChannel.cs, IpcServerChannel.cs: Added missing ctors.

	* IpcChannelHelper.cs: Removed the colon from the invalid pipe name
	chars, because it is a valid char on NT systems and some .NET IPC
	channel samples contain a colon in their port names.
