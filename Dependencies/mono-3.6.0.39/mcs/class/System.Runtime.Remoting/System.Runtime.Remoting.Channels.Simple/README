Example Channel Implementation:
===============================

This Channel is just used as example to show people how to implement remoting
Channels for mono. I tried to keep it as simple as possible, so it is not
feature complete.

Data Types:
===========

The channel wire format supports all basic data type. The formatter does not
handle exceptions itself, instead it passes them to the transport sink.

Overview
========

SimpleMessageFormat.cs: Contains routines to read/write messages transfered on
the network (low level message format)

SimpleWireFormat.cs: This is the data formatter.

SimpleClientChannel.cs: The client side of the channel.

	SimpleClientFormatterSink.cs: client side formatter sink
	SimpleClientFormatterSinkProvider.cs: and the formatter sink provider
	
	SimpleClientTransportSink.cs: client side transport sink  
	SimpleClientTransportSinkProvider.cs: and the transport sink provider

SimpleServerChannel.cs: The server side of the channel.

	SimpleServerFormatterSink.cs: server side formatter sink
	SimpleServerFormatterSinkProvider.cs: and the formatter sink provider

	SimpleServerTransportSink.cs: server side transport sink.

SimpleChannel.cs: combines SimpleClientChannel with SimpleServerChannel.
