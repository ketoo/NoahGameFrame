AtomParser_FeedUnexpected=Atom feed unexpected after other content has been found.
AtomParser_PagingLinkOutsideOfFeed=The link element used for paging must be a child of the atom:feed element.

AtomMaterializer_PropertyNotExpectedEntry=Property '{0}' of entity '{1}' is not an entity.

DataServiceQuery_EnumerationNotSupportedInSL=Silverlight does not enable you to directly enumerate over a data service query.
