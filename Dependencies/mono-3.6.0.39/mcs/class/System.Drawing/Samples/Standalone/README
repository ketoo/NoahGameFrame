This directory contains a few samples originally created with Visual Studio 
2005 to test certain features before implementing them into libgdiplus.

They are provided here, with a Makefile, to help test any changes in those
functionalities. All samples are compiled using gmcs (2.0).

* binary.exe

	Perform binary operation (union, intersect, exclude, complement and
	xoir) on regions of different shapes.

* clippy.exe

	Perform clipping using region of different shapes.

* flatten

	Convert different shapes (including beziers curves) into shapes 
	with only polygons.

* scan.exe

	Convert different shapes into a serie of rectangles.

* Samples.Common.dll

	Common code between the samples.
