 This README gives some details about Nunit tests and samples for
 System.Drawing classes.

 Following is the directory structure for the tests and samples:

	Test/		(all the nunit test classes go here)
		System.Drawing
		System.Drawing.Drawing2D
		System.Drawing.Imaging
		System.Drawing.Printing
		System.Drawing.Text

	Samples/	(all the samples go here)
		General (samples that affect more than a single area of SD)
		System.Drawing
		System.Drawing.Drawing2D
		System.Drawing.Imaging
		System.Drawing.Printing
		System.Drawing.Text

 Please note the directory structure given above is based on System.Drawing
 namespaces.

 Advice for writing System.Drawing tests/samples
 ===============================================

 Tests are Nunit test classes and follow general Nunit test guidelines. When
 you write a new test class, you need to add it to System.Drawing_test.dll.sources
 file. Please follow the alphabetical order while adding the name of your test
 class.

 Samples are independent C# programs with a Main method. Samples are supposed
 to solve two purposes. First, samples expose the bugs that are not captured
 by Nunit tests. To achieve this, it is advisable not to repeat the code in a
 test and a sample for any class until unless required. Second, samples help
 System.Drawing users in understanding System.Drawing components as well as in
 writing System.Drawing applications. Writing too trivial samples for well known
 classes might not be really helpful for the users. It is better to write a sample
 to solve a particular problem.
