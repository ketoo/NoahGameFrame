This contains the C# components of the Mono project.

	* Compilers written in C#

	* Class Libraries.

	* Regression Test Suites

To install this source code, look at the INSTALL file in the `mono'
package module which drives the compilation of this directory.

		a tool used to introspect types from assemblies from the 
		command line;  MonoStyle helps you keep your code indendented
		with the Mono programming style.

* Building Individual Directories
=================================

You can build individual components in the hierarchy by running the command
"make", and to install it use "make install".

By default, the 2.x profile is built, if you want to build the net 1.1 profile,
use the following command:

	make PROFILE=net_1_1

And to install:

	make PROFILE=net_1_1 install

To turn on verbose mode in the build (for example to diagnose a
problem), you can use the V=1 flag, like this:

	make V=1

* Running Unit tests
====================

You can run unit tests in individual components by running the command
"make run-test".  If you want to run tests for a different profile (say
'net_1_1')

	make run-test PROFILE=net_1_1

If you want to only run the tests in a single fixture (say
'MonoTests.System.TypeTest'), you can use

	make run-test TEST_HARNESS_FLAGS=/fixture:MonoTests.System.TypeTest

* Acknowledgements
==================

Thanks a lot to Sergey Chaban for his help during the development of
the C# compiler.
