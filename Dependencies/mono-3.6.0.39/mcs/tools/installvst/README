This is a _very_ quick hack to install those starter kits from http://asp.net/
which come with *.vstemplate files in the package.

Usage:

  installvst <full path to vstemplate> <full path to target directory>
  
A subdirectory with the name specified in the vstemplate file will be created
in the directory indicated above.
