Tasks necessary to complete the embedding:

	* Pass the main executable as the first argument to the
	  mono_main routine so it starts executing it.

Files:

	* Need to trace a typical execution and locate the files that this
	  will require at runtime, provide hooks of some form.

Windows Issues:

	* --static is not currently supported:

		The GC needs to be notified about new threads that is also
		possible using TLS callbacks. IMAGE_DIRECTORY_ENTRY_TLS
		has to be set in the PE image to an IMAGE_TLS_DIRECTORY
		containing PIMAGE_TLS_CALLBACKs that have the same
		functionality and signature as DllMain. This is also
		supported for EXE images. Visual C++ and Microsoft Linker
		have support for this but I don't know whether this is
		supported GCC.
		TLS callbacks should be implemented in the GC that would
		enable static linking.

		Using a statically linked eglib instead of glib could also
		reduce DLL dependency.

	* Document that the following DLLs are required to be deployed
	  along with the bundle. Do we need some legal blub if we
	  incite the user to deploy these binaries?

		[Mm]ono*.dll
		libglib*.dll
		libgmodule*.dll
		libgthread*.dll
		iconv.dll
		intl.dll
		zlib1.dll
