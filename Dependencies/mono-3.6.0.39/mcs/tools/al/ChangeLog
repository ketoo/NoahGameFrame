	* Al.cs: Ignore AssemblyKeyAttribute in template when KeyFile is null 
	or a zero-length string. Ignore AssemblyKeyNameAtribute in template
	when KeyName is null or a zero-length string. Fixes bug #82550.

	* Al.cs: Use DelaySign enum to capture whether a delaysign (+ or -)
	option was specified, and what value was set. This was necessary to
	make a distinction between leaving the default value (possibly
	obtained from a template assembly), and explicitly turned delay signing
	off. Removed unused IsStrongName method. Added support for absolute
	paths for modules on unix (borrowed from mcs). Previously absolute
	paths where reported as unrecognized command line options. Only add
	AssemblyDelaySignAttribute, AssemblyKeyFileAttribute and
	AssemblyKeyNameAttribute on 1.0 profile. Do not add an 
	AssemblyCultureAttribute if culture is specified, instead set the
	culture on the AssemblyName. When template is not an absolute path,
	then consider it to relative to the current directory. Removed unused
	AddResource method. Do not require template to be strongly signed;
	although MSDN states this, MS does not enforce this (and it should not).
	Template option take a file name, not an assembly name. Fixed bug
	#80440. When a template is set, use the keyfile specified in
	AssemblyKeyFileAttribute of that template to sign the assembly (unless
	overridden by /keyfile option). Same goes for AssemblyDelaySignAttribute
	and AssemblyKeyNameAttribute.

	* Al.cs: Use AssemblyBuilder.AddResourceFile instead of
	AddResourceFile when linkin to a resource, just as .NET
	does.
