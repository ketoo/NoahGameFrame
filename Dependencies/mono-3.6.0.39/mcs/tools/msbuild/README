WARNING: you are most likely NOT seeing what you are looking for. It is still
experimental implementation of "MSBuild" tool that is based on MSBuild's
"new" build engine a.k.a Microsoft.Build.dll (available only in .NET 4.0 or
later).

For old .NET 2.0-based MSBuild implementation, check out "xbuild" instead.
