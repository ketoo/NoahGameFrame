	* outline.cs: Small changes to allow the outline code to be embedded.

2005-10-10  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* options.cs: add --help output for the two new
	options

2005-10-10  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: add PrintRefs and use it if the
	option is set
	* options.cs: add PrintRefs option to see the
	assemblies referenced by an assembly

2005-10-10  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: don't print obsolete types if the
	--filter-obsolete option is passed
	* options.cs: add FilterObsolete option
	* outline.cs: don't print obsolete members if
	the --filter-obsolete option is passed

2005-09-21  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: catch exception on Process.Start
	when gacutil cannot be found to avoid annoying
	windows message boxes

2005-09-05  Michal Moskal  <malekith@nemerle.org>
	
	* outline.cs: Use new names of the GenericParameterAttributes enum.

2005-08-19  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@novell.com>

	* outline.cs:
	   - Support for `sealed'
	   - Handle iface impls with non-virtual methods
	   - ';' for delegates

2005-07-11  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile (PROGRAM): Make profile specific.
	* monop2.exe.sources: Remove.

2005-07-10  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: mark abstract methods with the "abstract" keyword.

2005-07-09  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: Actually get the namespacing conditions right so
	things look nice
	
	* outline.cs: Friendly display of ifaces on -d

	* outline.cs: Always show explicit interface impls. Don't display
	the wrong flags for them.

2005-07-07  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs:
	   - Print out static for fields (how the hell did I let myself
	   not put this in earlier!!!!!)
	   - To print out const fields, we might need to quote
	   things. This logic is not complete yet (for example, a string
	   with \n will have a literal new line)
	   - Try some smarter logic to get less verbosity by printing out
	   fewer namespaces
	   - Do a nicer sorting for methods. It sorts things by param
	   type, then from fewest params to most. This makes overloads
	   get sorted out cleanly.

2005-07-06 Gonzalo Paniagua Javier <gonzalo@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: prevent nullref for non-public events.

2005-07-04  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* *: begin support for 2.0

	* outline.cs: Add support for readonly fields.

2005-05-30  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: Don't show static constructors: they are cctors,
	which are uninteresting.

2005-01-22  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs (OutlineProperty) handle mixed accessability.

	* options.cs: Make things public.

	* outline.cs: Use the Options class, rather than being passed
	binding flags.
	(.ctor): Add Options param
	(OutlineType): remove bindingFlags param
	(DefaultFlags): Get the correct binding flags
	(ShowMember): Return true if we should show this member given the
	Options. Way too long due to MSFT stupidity.
	(OutlineType): call the above.

	* monop.cs (Main): Don't fiddle with binding flags ourselves.
	

2005-01-08  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: use Options class
	add a little print-runtime option
	(PrintTypes): respect --private option
	* options.cs: split out option parsing and improve it
	(simpler, order independent, less prone to crash)

2005-01-01  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* monop.cs (SearchType): Filter out non-public members and return
	the number of matches found. Use for loops instead of foreach
	loops. 
	(Main): Jump to `found' if we find only one matching type.
	
2004-12-30  Carlos Alberto Cortez <calberto.cortez@gmail.com>

	* outline.cs : Add support for enums having types different than int.
	
2004-12-30  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* monop.cs : csc build fix (see bug #70185).

2004-12-29  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* monop.cs (SearchType): New method, returns a list of type names
	that matches the method argument, either completely or partially.
	(GetKnownAssemblyNames): Renamed from GetAssemblyNamesFromGAC, as
	it now includes mscorlib in the return value.
	(Main): Added new flags: "--search", "-s", "-k". These flags will
	invoke SearchType. Prints out a list of Types and the location of
	the Assembly containing the Type.

	This fixes bug #70068.
	
2004-12-24  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: sort the types when printing an assembly
	handle -r:~/foo.dll by substituting for $HOME

	* outline.cs (OutlineType, OutlineOperator, OperatorFromName):
	Show overloaded operators and type conversions.
	(FormatType): fix the logic here so that, eg "System.Int32"
	becomes "int" rather than "Int32" when looking at a type in the
	System namespace.

2004-12-03  Atsushi Enomoto  <atsushi@ximian.com>

	* monop.cs : csc build fix. See bug #70185 for details.

2004-11-30  Duncan Mak  <duncan@ximian.com>

	* monop.cs (GetAssemblyNamesFromGAC): New method, calls out to
	"gacutil -l" and returns an array of Assembly fullnames. 
	(Main): Instead of probing the common_assemblies, use
	GetAssemblyNamesFromGAC. If we found the type via probing, print
	out a message noting the full type name and assembly name. This
	fixes bug #70043.
	
2004-11-11  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: Remove `public virtual' for interface methods.

2004-11-08  Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: If a type is in the namespace that we
	are looking at right now, dont print out the fullname
	this cuts down on verbosity

	* monop.cs: add MONO_PATH support

2004-08-13  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* outline.cs: remove unused isPointer 
	* monop.cs: show information about the assembly that is being used
	- remove unused IndentedTextWriter
	- rework how Assemblies are being loaded, so that it works by trying
	in order fromfile, fullname, partialname which fixes loading
	from relative paths and generally should be more correct
	* TODO: update

2004-08-06  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* outline.cs: add field support

2004-08-04  John Luke  <john.luke@gmail.com>

	* monop.cs: use assembly.LoadWithPartialName.

2004-04-29  Lluis Sanchez Gual  <lluis@ximian.com>

	* outline.cs: Property.GetGetMethod() does not return the method if it
	is private (it did until now because of a bug). Make sure it works as it 
	worked before the fix.

2004-04-27 Ben Maurer  <bmaurer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* outline.cs: Don't show the interfaces of an enum,
	s/;/, for enum. Style cop.

2004-04-27  John Luke <jluke@cfl.rr.com>

	* outline.cs: add GetTypeKind so we print
	enums and interfaces, instead of always class or
	struct	
	add a special case for enums so we just print the fields
