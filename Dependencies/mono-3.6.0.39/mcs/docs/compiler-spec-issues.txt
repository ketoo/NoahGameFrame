This document is to track limitations on the C# compiler spec, we
should have started this in 2001, but it is never too late.

* IntPtr and UIntPtr conversions

	The conversions to and from IntPtr and UIntPtr to other types
	and to enumerations was originally planned to be based on
	operator overloads, but it was eventually baked into the
	compiler due to historical accidents (See Luke's pasted reply
	in bug #XXXXXX)

	Currently MCS implements this based on observations made in
	real-life code.
