The lexical grammar (<hyperlink>9.2.1</hyperlink>) defines how Unicode characters are combined to form line terminators, white space, comments, tokens, and pre-processing directives. The syntactic grammar (<hyperlink>9.2.2</hyperlink>) defines how the tokens resulting from the lexical grammar are combined to form C# programs. </paragraph>
