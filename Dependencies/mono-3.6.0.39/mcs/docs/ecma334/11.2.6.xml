<clause number="11.2.6" title="Delegate types">
  <paragraph>A delegate is a data structure that refers to one or more methods, and for instance methods, it also refers to their corresponding object instances. </paragraph>
  <paragraph>
    <note>[Note: The closest equivalent of a delegate in C or C++ is a function pointer, but whereas a function pointer can only reference static functions, a delegate can reference both static and instance methods. In the latter case, the delegate stores not only a reference to the method's entry point, but also a reference to the object instance on which to invoke the method. end note]</note>
