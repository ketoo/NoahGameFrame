* Methods that should be static, but I cant commit now because of other patches:

	mono_class_set_failure
	mono_class_get_nullable_param
	mono_assembly_loaded_full

* Methods that might need to be static, but am not sure:
	mono_assembly_loaded_full
	mono_image_loaded_by_guid_full
	mono_image_loaded_full

* Namespacing

	Do we need to re-namespace the published helper_ routines to avoid
 	poluting the namespace?

		helper_compile_generic_method
		helper_ldstr
		helper_ldstr_mscorlib
		helper_newobj_mscorlib
		helper_stelem_ref
		helper_stelem_ref_check

* Need to make public:

	If the mono_mb_ interface is public, we need to make public:
	
	MonoWrapperType
	MonoDefaults.

* Generate a table of contents at the begining of each page for APIs.

* Fill in with a concept guide

* Install documentation into monodoc's standard location.

* Add support for inserting "api:" nodes into the index in the Monodoc XHTML provider.
