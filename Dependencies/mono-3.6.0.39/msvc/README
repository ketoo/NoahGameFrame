INTRODUCTION

	This directory (msvc) serves as a central location for all
	things needed to build the mono runtime using Microsoft Visual
	Studio.

BUILDING

	From this directory type:

	     msbuild.exe mono.sln /p:Configuration=Debug_eglib

	msbuild must be in your path, it comes with the .NET Framework.

MAINTENANCE

	When new exported API calls are added to the runtime, issue the
	command:

		make update-def

	in this directory and commit the resulting mono.def file.

	This must happen on a Linux system, because we get the list of
	the exported symbols from the generated shared library.
