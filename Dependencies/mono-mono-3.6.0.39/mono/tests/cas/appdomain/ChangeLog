	* Makefile: Added quota. Removed XML files generation.
	* quota.cs: New. Test if the restricted appdomain allows the # Kb of 
	IsolatedStorage.
	* README: Updated informations (quota and default policies).
	* sandbox.cs: Updated to support the "default" named permissions set
	(now) included with Mono. Support for loading XML policy files is 
	still available (but somewhat buggy at the moment).
