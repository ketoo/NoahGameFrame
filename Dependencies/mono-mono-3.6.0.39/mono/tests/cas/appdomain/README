AppDomain sandboxes


* makepol.cs:	Create some XML policy files to be used with the sandboxes.
		DEPRECATED as Mono now creates the default sets itself.
* sandbox.cs:	Create a policy-restricted appdomain to execute assemblies.


Samples

* whoami.cs:	Sample code that can be executed under a sandbox.
* quota.cs:	Sample code to test for a isolated storage quota permission.

Notes

[1]	This should be a "PolicyException: Execution permission cannot be 
	acquired." but it's a SecurityException on Mono (atm).
