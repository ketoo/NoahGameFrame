Tests for assembly-level security actions. The assembly request* actions can
only be used declaratively.

all.exe
* test for SecurityAction.RequestMinimum
* test for SecurityAction.RequestOptional
* test for SecurityAction.RequestRefuse

min.exe
* test for SecurityAction.RequestMinimum

opt.exe
* test for SecurityAction.RequestOptional

ref.exe
* test for SecurityAction.RequestRefuse

none.exe
* test that all three requests are empty.


Each file can be executed but no results will be visible (unless running on
Fx 2.0 later than beta1). Testing the files can be done using the Makefile
which use the security tool permview.
