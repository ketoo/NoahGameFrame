	* Makefile.am: Don't use --security to execute SN (since it's not
	part of the tests and fails verification due to other issues).
	<kumpera> spouliot: the issue is that, for some reason, M.M.BinInteger
	is been treated a code not under full trust (so no unsafe code)

2006-06-27  Wade Berrier <wberrier@novell.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use mcs and sn from the mcs tree instead of
	what's in the path.  Rename targets so tests are not compiled at
	build time.

2006-06-26  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Use mono-wrapper (and not the installed mono).

2006-06-22  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* Makefile.am: Updated Makefile to add the CAS tests to the tarball
	and enable them to be more broadly tested;
	* Makefile: Removed and replaced by Makefile.am

2005-06-16  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* aptc1.cs: Add a RequestRefuse for SkipVerification when RESTRICT is
	defined.
	* aptc2.cs: Add a RequestRefuse for SkipVerification when RESTRICT is
	defined. Change IsSigned() for IsRestricted().
	* icall1.cs: Fix typos.
	* Makefile: Changed compilation for aptc*.cs. Removed icall5.cs from 
	testing (until I figure out exactly the rules being used).
	* README: Updated informations about the APTC tests.

2005-03-14  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* icall1.cs: Fixed test to work on NET_2_0. We're now accepting the
	2.0 behaviour when dealing with icalls (as we do not keep their
	pblic status in the runtime).
	* icall2.cs: Fixed test to work on NET_2_0 as the icall has changed
	it's return value from bool to void. 
	* Makefile: Allow to build the tests with either NET_1_1 or NET_2_0.

2005-03-03  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* cas4-5.cs: Removed. Replaced by new refcas#.cs tests.

	* cas6-9.cs: New. CAS tests cases for NEWOBK (constructor), LDFTN
	(delegate) and LDVIRTFNT (delegate using a virtual method).
	* cas10.cs|.il: New. CAS test case for JMP. Not part of "make test"
	until #66033 is fixed (ILASM doesn't support decl security attrs).
	* Makefile: Updated makefile for new test cases.
	* README: Updated informations of new CAS tests.

2005-02-10  Sebastien Pouliot  <sebastien@ximian.com>

	* noncas1-4.cs: New. Non-CAS permission tests (derived from test cases
