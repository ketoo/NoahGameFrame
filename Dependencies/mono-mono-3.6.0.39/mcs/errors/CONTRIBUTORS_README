Mono MCS Errors.

	Errors in the Mono C# compiler use the same codes as the
	Microsoft C# compiler, the listing of the errors on it lives
	in:

	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/cscomp/html/vctbsCompilerErrorsSC0001ThroughSC9999.asp

* Format

	Error tests are stored in files with the format:

		csXXXX.cs 	for the first error.
		csXXXX-2.cs 	for the second way to trigger the error.
		csXXXX-n.cs	for subsequent ways of triggering the error. 
	
	The file should start with two inline commented lines.
	The first one contains a little description of the error, 
	the second line declares the line where the error occurs.

	You should not copy Microsoft's examples or documentation
	text.  You will need to write your own.
	
	For example:

	// CS0057: Inconsistent accessibility. Parameter type is less accessible than operator.
	// Line: 10
	
	** Note 1: If your error or warning message does not contain source line
	location use syntax `// Line : 0'

	** Note 2: Because in some special cases the error message can differ
	between runtimes. The special syntax exists where you can specify message
	for 2.0 runtime. 
	
	For example:

	// CS0057: Uknown error
	// GMCS0057: Uknown error 2.0
	// Line: 10


	There should not be more than one error per tests.  Each test
	should only contain one error.

	Then you have to add the file to the SVN and commit it.

	The next thing is to write a short text file with a little
	description of what the error is and what it's necessary
	to be done to solve it. 
        
* Compiler options

        If you need to run error test with some special option(s),
        use following syntax in your error test file.
        
        // cs0193.cs: * or -> operator can only be applied to pointer types.
        // Line: 9
        // Compiler options: -unsafe        

* Dependencies

        In case that your error test depends on the library or other C# file.
        Create separate file with same name as your error test name except
        first two letters which are uppercased. And then add this file to
        Makefile.

* Known errors

	Many of the errors in this test suite are not tested for by MCS. To cope
	with this, we have a list of failures, so that someone running the test
	can know if they have caused any regressions.
	
	In this model there are two types of regressions:
		* Incorrect error -- When mcs emits an error, but it is different
		  than the one CSC emits.
		  
		* No error -- When mcs incorrectly compiles an invalid file.
		
	`Incorrect error' regressions should be listed in mcs-expect-wrong-error.
	`No error' regressiions should be listed in mcs-expect-no-error.
	
	If you fix a bug and thus remove a regression, be sure to remove the file
	from the failures list!

* Errors not suported by Mono compiler

	Here is a list of errors reported by csc 1.0, 1.1 and not supported by Mono.
        Please add comment for every error.
