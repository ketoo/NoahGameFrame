<clause number="11.3" title="Boxing and unboxing">
  <paragraph>The concept of boxing and unboxing is central to C#'s type system. It provides a bridge between <non_terminal where="11.1">value-type</non_terminal>s and <non_terminal where="11.2">reference-type</non_terminal>s by permitting any value of a <non_terminal where="11.1">value-type</non_terminal> to be converted to and from type object. Boxing and unboxing enables a unified view of the type system wherein a value of any type can ultimately be treated as an object. </paragraph>
