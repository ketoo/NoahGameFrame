<clause number="17.5.5" title="Sealed methods">
  <paragraph>When an instance method declaration includes a sealed modifier, that method is said to be a sealed method. A sealed method overrides an inherited virtual method with the same signature. An override method can also be marked with the sealed modifier. Use of this modifier prevents a derived class from further overriding the method. </paragraph>
