<clause number="17.10.2" title="Instance variable initializers">
  <paragraph>When an instance constructor has no constructor initializer, or it has a constructor initializer of the form base(...), that constructor implicitly performs the initializations specified by the <non_terminal where="19.6">variable-initializer</non_terminal>s of the instance fields declared in its class. This corresponds to a sequence of assignments that are executed immediately upon entry to the constructor and before the implicit invocation of the direct base class constructor. The variable initializers are executed in the textual order in which they appear in the class declaration. </paragraph>
</clause>
