System.Runtime.Remoting.Channels.Ipc.Win32
==========================================

*.Ipc.Win32 is a concrete IPC channel implementation for Win32
using named pipes for the transport sink.

Differences to MSFT's implementation:

- the "secure" channel property is not implemented.

- the implementations are not interoperable. Not a big issue,
  because the IPC channel is a local channel.

About the Named Pipe implementation:

My "native" Win32 implementation for MSFT's .NET used I/O completion ports.
I was not able to port them to Mono because some required functionality
was missing (ThreadPool.BindHandle for example).
