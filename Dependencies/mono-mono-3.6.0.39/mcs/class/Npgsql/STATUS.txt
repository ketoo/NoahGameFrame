	- Npgsql is now capable of sending some queries like select count(*) from table
	with NpgsqlCommand.ExecuteScalar() method.

	- Npgsql is now capable of sending some queries like insert, update and delete.
	Note that parameters in these queries aren't work yet. So they must be 'full'
	queries like insert into <table> values (<value1>, <value2>, ...).
