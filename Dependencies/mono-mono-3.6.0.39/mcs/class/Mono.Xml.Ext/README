* Mono.Xml.Ext.dll readme

** Introduction

	Mono.Xml.Ext.dll holds those features listed below:

	<ul>
		* XQuery implementation
		* custom XmlResolver
		* DTMXPathNavigator (exactly the same one as XPathNavigator)
	</ul>

** XQuery implementations

	XQuery is implemented in Mono.Xml.XPath2 namespace. The entry point
	of XQuery command is Mono.Xml.XPath2.XQueryCommandImpl class. Below
	is a simple example:

	private void ExecuteXQuery (string xqueryString,
		XPathNavigator input, XmlWriter output)
	{
		XQueryCommandImpl cmd = new XQueryCommandImpl ();
		cmd.Load (new StringReader (xqueryString), null, null);
		cmd.Execute (input, null, null, output);
	}

	It is designed to implement the latest working draft of W3C XQuery
	specification (as of now 2004/07/24 version), while it keeps some
	URI as old XQuery one (for example, http://www.w3.org/2003/11/xquery).
	It is just for testing convenience; XQuery Use Cases is still based
	on an old version).

	Currently only XQueryCommandImpl and XmlArgumentList are intended
	to be public (originally XQueryCommandImpl is not intended to be
	public).

	Note that it is highly unstable, buggy, subject to many changes.

** DTMXPathNavigator

	DTMXPathNavigator is an implementation of XPathNavigator which is
	based on document table model aka DTM.

	Actually DTMXPathNavigator is exactly the same as Mono's XPathDocument
	implementation, so basically this means nothing for Mono users.
