	* SqlSharpCli.cs: fixes for using DbConnectionStringBuilder,
	do not allow changing of provider or opening when the
	connection is already open

2008-08-27  Daniel Morgan <monodanmorg@yahoo.com>

	* SqlSharpcli.cs: use foreach to get keys
	in DbConnectionStringBuilder

	* ChangeLog: fix previous entry of mine

2008-08-27  Daniel Morgan <monodanmorg@yahoo.com>

	* SqlSharpcli.cs: start using ADO.NET 2.0 features 
	such as provider factories and connection string builders
	but still be backwards compatible with prior ADO.NET providers.

	Added new commands:
		\bcs for building your connection string for you by prompting
		\cs short for \connectionstring
		\p short for \provider
		\listp or \listproviders to list DbProviderFactories
		    listed in the machine.config file.

	Building with gmcs now which means the NET_2_0 profile.

	* SqlSharpCli.cs: make the MySQL Connector/Net the default mysql provider.  
	If people still need to use ByteFX, they can use bytefx.  Update assembly
	version for Firebird SQL.
	
	* README: update MySQL provider info

2004-12-27  Alp Toker <alp@atoker.com>

	* SqlSharpCli.cs: Math and Mono.Math clash. Refer to System.Math directly to
	unbreak the build. Another approach would be to move the using System
	statement within the namespace block. Both have caveats.

	* SqlSharpCli.cs: change formatting style from vs.net default
	to mono style, display results better aligned

2004-10-21  Daniel Morgan <danielmorgan@verizon.net>

	* SqlSharpCli.cs: removed obsolete providers (Mono.Data.MySql, 
	Mono.Data.PostgreSqlClient, Mono.Data.DB2Client), 
	added provider for FirebirdSql.Data.Firebird, fixed 
	loading of external providers so they work with
	Mono having a GAC

2004-06-09  Raja R Harinath  <rharinath@novell.com>

	* Makefile (HAS_TEST): Remove.
	(run-test-local): Disable for now.  Move rules to ...

2003-02-16  Daniel Morgan <danmorg@sc.rr.com>

	provider is set to oracle, it should default
	to not using the simple reader

	via \provider sybase which is easier than SQL# command
	\loadextprovider Mono.Data.SybaseClient Mono.DataSybaseClient.SybaseConnection
