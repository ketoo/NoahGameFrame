	* sqlmetal.exe.source: Add additional files.

2010-03-29  Raja R Harinath  <harinath@hurrynot.org>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Make internals visible to the test suite.

2010-01-04  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: Ensure that Test/* files are distributed (so that 
	  'make check' works on tarball builds).  Partial fix for #564987.

2009-12-08  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* sqlmetal.exe.config: Add provider entry for SQL Server.
	* sqlmetal.exe.sources: Add additional files.

2009-11-06  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* Makefile: re-enable the tests.  They were disabled in r137153
	  because they weren't compiling, which was because System.Data.Linq
	  wasn't listing sqlmetal_net_2_0 as a friend assembly.  (Why this
	  built before I couldn't tell you...)  Fixed in latest S.D.L.

2009-04-30  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* sqlmetal.exe.config: The MySQL provider should use ByteFX.Data's
	  MySQL connection types, as those are actually included with Mono
	  (unlike MySql.Data, which isn't included with Mono).

2009-04-08  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Building against the local AssemblyInfo.cs broke
	  sqlmetal, as it couldn't find an IProcessor implementation (as the
	  local AssemblyInfo.cs was missing a [assembly: DbLinq] attribute).
	  Fix so that sqlmetal works again.
	* Makefile: Actually enable NUnit tests.

2009-04-06  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* . (svn:ignore): Ignore generated files.
	* AssemblyInfo.cs: Added; Assembly-level attributes for sqlmetal.exe.
	* Makefile: Correct the "namespace" of the embedded resource files;
	  build NUnit tests for sqlmetal.exe.
	* sqlmetal.exe.sources: Build against the local AssemblyInfo.cs, not
	  DbMetal's AssemblyInfo.cs file.
	* sqlmetal_test.dll.sources: Added; source files for the NUnit test.
	* Test/AssemblyInfo.cs: Added; Assembly-level attributes for the NUnit
	  test assembly.

2009-03-12  Jonathan Pryor <jonpryor@vt.edu>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile, sqlmetal.exe.config, sqlmetal.exe.sources:
	  Added; builds `sqlmetal.exe', which is the Mono version of DbLinq's
	  DbMetal.exe program (which in turn is modeled on .NET's SQLMETAL
	  tool), "tuned" to depend only on Mono's System.Data.Linq.
