* Size sample

	This sample provides a new internal call that can be used to
	obtain the size of an object and all of the referenced objects
	that this object holds.

	This is exposed in the method:

	int Mono.ObjectServices.ObjectInspector.GetMemoryUsage (object x)

	Available in the objectinspector.dll file;   To use this, you
	must run Mono with the --profile=size argument (and have the
	libmono-profile-size.so module in your path). 
	
* Inner Details.

	This implementation used a profiler hook at jit-end to install
	a new internal call, and exposes a small DLL
	(objectinspector.dll).

	There is no need to use the profiler, the method body that
	does the object size computation can be copy/pasted elsewhere,
	particularly on embedded uses of Mono.
