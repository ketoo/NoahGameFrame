NFCoreEx is the core of my development game tool kit, because my the tool kit'code are developed  by c++, so developed a c # version especially.

NFCoreEx is all the object management, property management, and record management in integration.

What can you do with NFCoreEx?

you can create a virtual game object and can get it all message by NFCoreEx easily,
for examples,
you can gei the callback when the object be created and destroied, and when it' property update or record update.
you can attach a heartbeat in a object and get the callback easily.
you can find and set it record and property conveniently with unified interface.

What is important is that the NFCoreEx has nothing to do with any rendering engine, it can use on multiple engines to use.
Behind and there will be a full version of mmo tool kit with server for Unity
